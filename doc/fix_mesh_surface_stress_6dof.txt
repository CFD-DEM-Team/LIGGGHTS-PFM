fix mesh/6dof command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID mesh/surface/stress/6dof file filename premesh_keywords premesh_values mesh_keywords mesh_values surface_keyword surface_values stress_keywords stress_values 6dof_keywords 6dof_values :pre

ID, is documented in "fix"_fix.html command, the group-ID is ignored for this command. :ulb,l
mesh/gran/6dof = style name of this fix command  :l
file filename premesh_keywords premesh_values mesh_keywords mesh_values surface_keyword surface_values stress_keywords stress_values are documented in "fix mesh/surface/stress"_fix_mesh_surface_stress.html. :l
zero or more 6dof_keyword/value pairs may be appended 
6dof keywords = {mass} (obligatory) or {com} (obligatory) or {moi} (obligatory) or {vcm} or {angmom} or {suspension}  or {forceflags} or {torqueflags} :l
{mass} value = mass
   mass = mass of the rigid body (mass units)
{com} values = x, y, z
    x, y, z = coordinates of the center of mass of the body (distance units)
{moi} values = Ixx, Iyy, Izz, Ixy, Ixz, Iyz
    Ixx, Iyy, Izz, Ixy, Ixz, Iyz = moments of inertia around the given axis
{vel} values = vx, vy, vz
    vx, vy, vz = velocities of the center of mass of the body (velocity units)
{angmom} values = ax, ay, az
    ax, ay, az = initial angular momentum around x-, y-, and z-axis
{suspension} values = k_t kt c_t ct k_r kr c_r cr
    k_t = obligatory keyword
    kt = stiffness for translational spring
    c_t = obligatory keyword
    ct = damper coefficient for translational damper
    k_r = obligatory keyword
    kr = stiffness for rotational spring
    c_r = obligatory keyword
    cr = damper coefficient for rotational damper
{forceflags} values = f1 f2 f3
    f1,f2,f3 = flags for x,y,z which can be 0 or 1
{torqueflags} values = t1 t2 t3
    t1,t2,t3 = flags for x,y,z which can be 0 or 1 :pre

[LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info:]

This command is not available in LAMMPS.

[Description:]

This fix implements the functionality of "fix mesh/surface/stress"_fix_mesh_surface_stress.html but it additionally 
integrates the motion of the mesh assuming it to be a rigid body with the given {com} (center of mass) 
and {moi} (moments of inertia). Optionally, you can specify an initial velocity and angular momentum of 
the rigid body. Please note the difference between angular velocity omega and angular momentum (which is I*omega)

Note that if a "fix gravity"_fix_gravity.html is used, the gravitational force acts on the center of mass
of the body

With the optional {suspension} keyword, an additional suspension force and torque is activated 
which tries to pull the body back into its original position (which is the {com} as defined by 
this command) and its original orientation. The force and torque consist of translational and 
rotational spring/damping parts and write

f = kt * dx - ct * vel
t = kr * dalpha * axis - cr * omega

where vec and omega are the body velocity and rotational velocity. dx represents the translational 
displacement of the body from its original position. dalpha and axis represent the rotational
displacement of the body from its original orientation, where dalpha is the the angle
and axis is the the corresponding rotation (unit) axis.

With the optional {forceflags} and {torqueflags} keywords, motion integration can be turned of
separately for the x-, y-, and z-axis.

[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

This fix stores a global vector with 6 components for access by various "output commands"_Section_howto.html#4_15. 
The first 3 components are equal to the total force on the mesh, the last 3 components store the total torque 
on the body. The last 3 components store the position of the center of mass of the body.
Please note that as opposed to "fix mesh/surface/stress"_fix_mesh_surface_stress.html, 
the total force and torque contain the contributions of the particles, gravity and the suspension
model (if activated). 
Furthermore, this fix writes the state of the rigid body (translational and rotational) to binary restart files so 
that a simulation can continue correctly.

[Restrictions:]

When using this fix, along with scaling or rotate the body, all the 6dof_keyword/value pairs have to represent
the state after scaling/rotation.
Mesh elements may not be deleted in case due to leaving the simulation box for a fixed boundary. 
In this case, an error is generated. See "boundary"_boundary.html command for details.
This fix can not be used in conjunction with another fix that manipulates mesh geometry,
such as a "fix move/mesh"_fix_move_mesh.html

[Related commands:]

[Default:] 
{vel} = 0 0 0, {angmom} = 0 0 0, {forceflags} = 1 1 1, {torqueflags} = 1 1 1 , {suspension} = off
