thermo_log command :h3

[Syntax:]

thermo_log file keyword :pre

file = name of new thermo logfile
keyword = {append} if output should be appended to thermo logfile (optional) :ul

[Examples:]

thermo_log log.equil
thermo_log log.equil append :pre

[Description:]

This command closes any current LAMMPS thermo log file, opens a new file with
the specified name, and begins logging thermo information to it.  If the
specified file name is {none}, then no new thermo log file is opened.  If the
optional keyword {append} is specified, then output will be appended
to an existing thermo log file, instead of overwriting it.

If multiple processor partitions are being used, the file name should
be a variable, so that different processors do not attempt to write to
the same thermo log file.

The default setting for the thermo log file is {none}.  The
name of the thermo log file can also be set by the command-line
switch -thermo.  See "Section 2.7"_Section_start.html#start_7 for
details.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

By default no separate thermo log file is created.
