[LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info:]

This command is not available in LAMMPS.

[Description:]

Apply the discrete fragmentation method (DFM) to simulate the breakage of
brittle granular particles (see "Bruchmüller"_#Bruchmueller2011 and "Esnault"_#Esnault2013).

The {verbose} keyword controlls whether statistics about particle
breakage is output to the screen each time particles are broken.

This command must use the {distributiontemplate} keyword to refer to a 
"fix_particledistribution_discrete"_fix_particledistribution_discrete.html 
(defined by dist-ID) that defines the properties of the inserted particles.
The "fix_particledistribution_discrete"_fix_particledistribution_discrete.html
in turn must refer to exactly one "fix_particletemplate_fragments"_fix_particletemplate_fragments.html

At each invocation step, fix break/particle checks the breakage criterion
of the particles in the group defined by group-ID. The breakage criterion
can be based either on impact energy (keyword {energy_threshold}),
a maximum amount of force (keyword {force_threshold}), or the von Mises stress
(keyword {von_mises_stress}). Exactly one out of the keywords {energy_threshold},
{force_threshold}, {von_mises_stress} must be defined.

The frequency of the check can be controlled by the keyword {every},
which defines the number of time-steps between two checks. In case of
the impact energy criterion, {every} must be set to 1 to detect the
moment of impact correctly.

The {start} keyword can be used to set the time-step at which the insertion 
should start.

Inserted fragments are assigned to 4 groups: the default group "all" and the group
specified in the fix break/particle command, as well as the groups specified 
in the "fix_particledistribution_discrete"_fix_particledistribution_discrete.html
and "fix_particletemplate_fragments"_fix_particletemplate_fragments.html
command (all of which can also be "all").

Fragments are inserted without any overlap with other existing particles or walls. 
Due to this packing, fragments of the same broken particle may have an initial
overlap which is scaled accordingly to conserve energy.

The {breakability} option specifies the strength value of the particles.
This can be a constant value ({constant}), a uniformly distributed random
number ({uniform}), or a gaussian distribution of numbers ({gaussian}).

Use the {energy_threshold} keyword to apply the impact energy criterion.
The value to be specified is the constant product of particle diameter
and mass specific threshold energy {dE0}. The probability of breakage is
calculated as

:c,image(Eqs/fix_break_particle_p_energy.png)

Use the {force_threshold} keyword to apply the maximum force criterion.
The value to be specified is the characteristic force {F0} (i.e., most
breakage events will take place for forces of order {F0}). The probability
of breakage is calculated as

:c,image(Eqs/fix_break_particle_p_force.png)

Use the {von_mises_stress} keyword to apply the von Mises stress criterion.
The value to be specified is the characteristic stress {sigma0} (i.e., most
breakage events will take place for stresses of order {sigma0}). The probability
of breakage is calculated as

:c,image(Eqs/fix_break_particle_p_stress.png)

The Weibull modulus {m} in the probability functions is set to one in the current
implementation.

The material parameter {fMat} characterises the resistance against fracture.
In case of the impact energy based criterion, it is related to the Julius Kruttschnitt
standard "slope" parameter determined experimentally in drop weight tests and is
specified in kg/Jm. For the the maximum force and the von Mises stress criterion
{fMat} is a dimensionless model parameter multiplied by 1/d<sub>0</sub> and
1/d<sub>0</sub><sup>3</sup>, respectively.

Any of {fMat}, {energy_threshold}, {force_threshold} and {von_mises_stress}
can be specified as an equal-style or atom-style "variable"_variable.html.
If the value is a variable, it should be specified as v_name, where name is
the variable name. In this case, the variable will be evaluated each timestep.

Equal-style variables can specify formulas with various mathematical
functions, and include "thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command
keywords for the simulation box parameters and timestep and elapsed
time.

Atom-style variables can specify the same formulas as equal-style
variables but can also include per-atom values, such as atom
coordinates. Thus it is easy to specify a spatially-dependent breakage
criterion with optional time-dependence as well.

To limit the number of fragments created in the course of a simulation,
the {min_radius} option can be used to define a minimum particle radius,
below which no breakage will occur.


[Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:]

Information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html. This means you can restart a simulation
while breaking particles, when the restart file was written during the
breakage operation. 

None of the "fix_modify"_fix_modify.html options are relevant to this
fix. A global vector is stored by this fix for access by various "output
commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15. The first component of the vector is the
number of particle templates already inserted, the second component is the mass
of particles already inserted. No parameter of this fix can be
used with the {start/stop} keywords of the "run"_run.html command.
This fix is not invoked during "energy minimization"_minimize.html.

[Restrictions:]

This fix requires the "pair_style gran"_pair_gran.html to be used with either
[hertz/break] or [hooke/break] specified as model.

[Related commands:]

"fix_particledistribution_discrete"_fix_particledistribution_discrete.html,
"fix_particletemplate_fragments"_fix_particletemplate_fragments.html

[Default:]

The defaults are verbose = yes, start = next time-step, breakability = uniform, min_radius = 0
