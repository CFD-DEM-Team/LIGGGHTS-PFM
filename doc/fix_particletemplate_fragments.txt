fix particletemplate/fragments command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID particletemplate/fragments seed keyword values ...  :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
particletemplate/fragments = style name of this fix command  :l
seed = random number generator seed (integer value) :l
zero or more keyword/value pairs can be appended :l
keyword = {atom_type} or {density} or {breakage_index} or {tn_family} or {maxattempt} or {omit_radius} :l
  {atom_type} value = atom type assigned to this particle template
  {density} values = random_style param1 (param2)
    random_style = 'constant' or 'uniform' or 'gaussian'
    param1 = density for 'constant', low value of density for 'uniform', expectancy value for 'gaussian'
    param2 = omitted for 'constant', high value of density for 'uniform', sigma value for 'gaussian'
  {breakage_index} values = A minsize
    A = maximum achievable t10 in a single breakage event
    minsize = minimum size of generated fragments (fraction of parent particle size)
  {tn_family} values = n frac1 (frac2 ...)
    n = number of size distribution curves tn to use
    frac = tn family curve to use
  {maxattempt} value = n
    n = number of attempts to pack a fragment into the volume of the parent particle with minimum overlap
  {omit_radius} values = ogenerate orad
    ogenerate = omit fragments {pre} or {post} generation of actual size distribution
    orad = minimum radius below which fragments will be removed from simulation :pre
:ule

[LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS Info:]

This LIGGGHTS command is not available in LAMMPS.

[Description:]

Define a particle template that is used as input for a
"fix_particledistribution_discrete"_fix_particledistribution_discrete.html
command to produce fragments of particles for the discrete fragmentation method (DFM).

You can choose the atom type, density and radius distribution of the particles.
For density, you can choose between 'constant', 'uniform' and 'gaussian' random styles.
The radius distribution is determined by the breakage index {t10} calculated from
the breakage probability {P} of a "fix_break_particle"_fix_break_particle.html

:c,image(Eqs/fix_particletemplate_fragments.png)

{t10} is the cumulative mass percentage of the fragments which are smaller than 1/10
of the parent particle size and {A} is the maximum achievable {t10} in a single
breakage event. This parameter is uniquely related to other points on a family of size
distribution curves {tn}, thus yielding the particle size distribution (PSD).

The {breakage_index} option defines {A} and the minimum size of fragments created
(specified as fraction of the parent particle size).

The {tn_family} values specify the tn family curves used to generate the size
distribution of fragments.

The {maxattempt} option determines the number of attempts to pack a fragment
into the volume of the parent particle with a minimum overlap. Note that if
this value is exceeded, large overlaps of fragments may occur.

The {omit_radius} option allows to neglect fragments below a certain size
to speed up the simulation. This can be done by either subtracting the 
corresponding mass fraction from the parent particle mass (keyword {pre}) or
by generating the size distribution from the given tn family curves and 
subsequently omitting fragments which are smaller than the given radius
(keyword {post}).
