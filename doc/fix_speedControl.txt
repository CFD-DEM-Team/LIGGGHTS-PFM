fix speedControl command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID speedControl vx vy vz keyword value ... :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
speedControl = style name of this fix command :l
vx,vy,vz = set-velocity component values (velocity units) :l
  any of vx,vy,vz can be a variable (see below) :pre
zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended to args :l
keyword = {region} or {gain} :l
  {region} value = region-ID
    region-ID = ID of region atoms must be in to have added force
  {gain} value = gain
    gain = proportional gain of the proportional controller :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

fix kick flow speedControl 1.0 0.0 0.0
fix kick flow speedControl 1.0 0.0 v_oscillate region force_reg
fix kick flow speedControl 0.0 NULL v_push gain v_gain :pre

[Description:]

Add vx,vy,vz to the corresponding component of the set-velocity for 
each atom in the group. This command can be used to constrain the 
velocity of the atoms in a simulation, e.g. at an outlet with a 
well-defined massflow (screw conveyor).

This fix applies a force to each atom which is proportional to the 
controller gain times the difference between the atom's velocity and 
the set-velocity.

Any of the 3 quantities defining the set-velocity can be specified
as an equal-style or atom-style "variable"_variable.html, namely {vx},
{vy}, {vz}.  If the value is a variable, it should be specified as
v_name, where name is the variable name.  In this case, the variable
will be evaluated each timestep, and its value(s) used to determine
the set-velocity component. Any of the x,y,z values can be specified 
as NULL which means do not include that dimension in the application 
of the velocity controller.

Equal-style variables can specify formulas with various mathematical
functions, and include "thermo_style"_thermo_style.html command
keywords for the simulation box parameters and timestep and elapsed
time.  Thus it is easy to specify a time-dependent force field.

Atom-style variables can specify the same formulas as equal-style
variables but can also include per-atom values, such as atom
coordinates.  Thus it is easy to specify a spatially-dependent force
field with optional time-dependence as well.

If the {region} keyword is used, the atom must also be in the
specified geometric "region"_region.html in order to have its velocity 
controlled.
