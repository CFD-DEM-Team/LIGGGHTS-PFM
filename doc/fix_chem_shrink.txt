[LIGGGHTS vs. LAMMPS info:]

This command is not available in LAMMPS.

[Description:]

The mass flow rate for the reactant gas species can be calculated with the equation

dmA = -k*rho_gas*Y_a*Particle_surface_area*dt,

in which Y_a and rho_gas are the reactant gas species concentration and the
density at the particle location.
The mass flow rates of particle and product gas can then be calculated as

dmB =  dmA*MolarMassB/MolarMassA,

dmC = -dmA*MolarMassC/MolarMassA.

The calculation of mass flow rate of the particle allows us to determine the new
mass at each time step, and thus the new radius of particle.
Since the particle reacts with gas, the radius will shrink.

With the help of the user defined {rmin} value, the minimum particle radius is
defined. Particles that reach the {rmin} value are deleted from the domain in
order to avoid numerical complications.

It must be kept in mind that the mass flow rates depend highly on the reaction
rate coefficient.
The higher the reaction rate constant, the faster the reduction of the particle
will be.
