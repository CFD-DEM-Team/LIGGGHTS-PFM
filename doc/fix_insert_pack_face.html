<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Insert particles recorded by <A HREF = "fix_massflow_mesh_face.html">fix massflow/mesh/face</A>
into a granular run every few timesteps within the specified region,
as defined via the <I>region</I> keyword. The region of type mesh/hex must
hold the element property 'face_id' corresponding to the 'face_id' property
of the mesh used in fix massflow/mesh/face. This command uses a distributiontemplate
generated automatically from the data collected by fix massflow/mesh/face to define
the properties of the inserted particles.
</P>
<P>The <I>verbose</I> keyword controls whether statistics about particle
insertion is output to the screen each time particles are inserted.
</P>
<P>At each insertion step, fix insert/pack/face tries to insert all particles
recorded by fix massflow/mesh/face since the last insertion.
</P>
<P>The frequency of the particle insertion can be controlled by the 
keyword <I>insert_every</I>, which defines the number of time-steps between 
two insertions.
</P>
<P>The <I>start</I> keyword can be used to set the time-step at which the insertion 
should start.
</P>
<P>Inserted particles are assigned the atom types recorded by fix massflow/mesh/face
which can be altered via the <I>type_offset</I> keyword. The particles are assigned to
2 groups: the default group "all" and the group specified in the fix insert command.
</P>
<P>Overlap is checked for at insertion, both within the inserted particle package
and with other existig particles. The number of insertion attempts per particle
can be specified via the <I>maxattempt</I> keyword. Each timestep particles are inserted,
the command will make up to a total of M tries to insert the new particles without
overlaps, where M = # of inserted particles * <I>maxattempt</I>.
If unsuccessful at completing all insertions, a warning will be printed.
</P>
<P>The <I>all_in</I> flag determines if the particle is completely contained 
in the insertion region (<I>all_in yes</I>) or only the particle center 
(<I>all_in no</I>).
</P>
<P>The initial velocity is determined by the face- and mass-averaged data
gathered by fix massflow/mesh/face.
</P>
<P><B>Description for fix insert/pack/face:</B>
</P>
<P>This command must use the <I>region</I> keyword to define an insertion
volume. The specified region must have been previously defined with a
<A HREF = "region.html">region mesh/hex</A> command. Dynamic regions are not supported
as insertion region. Each timestep particles are inserted, they are placed
randomly inside the hexahedral cell of the insertion volume that corresponds
to the face of the surface mesh used by fix massflow/mesh/face. 
</P>
<P>The <I>massflow_face</I> must be used to specify a
<A HREF = "fix_massflow_mesh_face.html">fix massflow/mesh/face</A> command that
determines the number and parameters of the particles to insert.
</P>
<P>The <I>cg</I> value determines the coarse grain ratio of the particles to insert.
</P>
<P>The <I>type_offset</I> option can be used to change the atom type of the
inserted particles from the atom type of the particles recorded by
fix massflow/mesh/face. The given offset is added to the original atom type.
</P>
<P>To determine the volume of each hexahedron of the insertion region,
a Monte Carlo approach is used. The <I>ntry_mc</I> keyword is used to control
the number of MC tries that are used for the volume calculation.
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>Information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  This means you can restart a simulation
while inserting particles, when the restart file was written during the
insertion operation. 
</P>
<P>None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options are relevant to this
fix. A global vector is stored by this fix for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">output
commands</A>. The first component of the vector is the
number of particles already inserted, the second component is the mass
of particles already inserted. No parameter of this fix can be
used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
